Hi there, I am **Davide Dolce**, I am specialized mostly in BackEnd technologies. I've experience with .NET Framework, .NET Core, Microsoft Azure, C#, Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce, Windows and GNU/Linux. I  also developed in Typescript, Node.js, C/C++, Python, Ruby, Lua, Laravel, PHP, Java, JSP and Vue.js.

I got a Diploma in Computer Science from [Giuseppe Peano (Italy)](https://www.iispeano.edu.it/) high school and an Associate Degree in Integrated Back-End Services, from [ITS ICT Piemonte (Italy)](http://www.its-ictpiemonte.it/) with a score of 84/100.

I created two videogames, they are based on the fighting game style, [Supreme Word Of Fighters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldaEnFMK7nY) and [Warriors of the Astral Plane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_oFZxTJLio) have reached thousands of downloads. I made a bot called [RaptorSA](https://github.com/MalwareWerewolf/RaptorSA) which reached more than 50 stars and more than 60 forks on Github, I also got the [Artic Code Vault Contributor](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/) badge on my Github profile, a program to store code for future generations.

Besides contributing to open source and creating other projects, I like to make some youtube videos on my channel to share my knowledge with the community.
