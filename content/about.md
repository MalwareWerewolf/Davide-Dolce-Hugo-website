Hi there, I am **Davide Dolce**, I am specialized mostly in BackEnd technologies. I've experience with .NET Framework, .NET Core, Microsoft Azure, C#, Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce, Windows and GNU/Linux, I  also developed in Typescript, Node.js, C/C++, Python, Ruby, Lua, Laravel, PHP, Java, JSP, Vue.js.

I'm working as Salesforce Developer at [Accenture (Milan, Italy)](https://www.accenture.com/us-en), previously I worked in other IT companies like [Betacom](https://www.betacom.it/) and [Reply](https://www.reply.com/).

I got a Diploma in Computer Science from [Giuseppe Peano (Italy)](http://iispeano.gov.it/) high school and an Associate Degree in Integrated Back-End Services, from [ITS ICT Piemonte (Italy)](http://www.its-ictpiemonte.it/) with a score of 84/100.

I created two videogames, they are based on the fighting game style, **Supreme Word Of Fighters** has reached 2k of downloads. I made a bot called **RaptorSA** which reached more than 30 stars and more than 50 forks on Github, I also got the Artic Code Vault Contributor badge on my Github profile, a program to store code for future generations.

Besides creating open source or other projects, I like to make some youtube videos on my channel to share my knowledge in order with other users.
