## RaptorSA

![RaptorSA](/images/projects/RaptorSA.png)

RaptorSA is a multi function bot, with more than 40 commands, you can listen to music, manage roles, get various information about a server and many other things. This Discord bot can be helpful for anyone who wants to learn how to make a discord.js bot. I made this so new users can also look at the methods used for certain commands and get some ideas for their Discord bot.
